#+TITLE: session-recorder

~session-recorder~ (formerly ~swank-recorder~) is a simple library to record input sent to Lisp via Slime or Sly. It records the ~internal-real-time~ and the string of code to a file of your choosing. Just load the system, call ~(start-recording "/path/to/your/output/log.lisp")~ and go! A ~stop-recording~ function is provided, but not strictly needed since each output is flushed immediately.

Playback of recordings is also in the works, though not fully functional at the moment yet.
