#+TITLE: swank-recorder

~swank-recorder~ is a simple library to record input sent to Swank. It records the ~internal-real-time~ and the string of code to a file of your choosing. Just load the system, call ~(start-recording "/path/to/your/output/log.lisp")~ and go! A ~stop-recording~ function is provided, but not strictly needed since each input to Swank is flushed immediately.

* Future

- Sub-system for playing back recorded sessions.
